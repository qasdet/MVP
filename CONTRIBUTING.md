## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you wish to suggest a feature or enhancement, please enter a GitHub issue with the "enhancement" label detailing the suggestion.

## Code review process

As I'm just one person, and my scripting is a side-project to my normal sysadmin/syseng work, it may take me a while to review.

## Questions

If you have additional questions about contributing, please open a GitHub issue with the "question" tag.

## Code Style

I write all my PowerShell code according to the [PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle), so any contributions will be altered to match this style if they do not already follow it.

## Notes

This page was created based mostly on [Nate Contributing page](https://github.com/natescherer/ChangelogManagement/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Thank you !
